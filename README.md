# Vehicle Type Classification using Transfer Learning
Computer Vision course - Final Project \
In this project, I have developed a model which classifies vehicles as light or heavy. Instead of training a Neural Network from scratch, I used VGG19 and added two Dense layers on top. the Dataset is available at: http://mbt925.ir/publications.html
